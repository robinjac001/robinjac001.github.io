                <p class="paragraph">
                    Thomas Harold Flowers also known as Tommy was born in London on December 22, 1905.
                    In WWII Flowers worked as a code breaker in Bleatchy Park and was tasked with helping Alan Turing.
                    Flowers and Turing would go on to change code breaking forever.
                    Flowers and Turing would help automate code breaking with the use of simple (by todays standards) computers.
                    Flowers would go on to make the Colossus and Mark II Colossi which take in a tape with the encoded German text and would run an algorithm to decrypt the message.
                    The original Colossus ran at 5,000 characters per second and Mark II ran at 25,000 characters per second.
                    Without Flowers work the German Enigma machine and other similar encoding machines would have taken much longer to crack.
                    Flowers saved countless lives with important messages being revealed to British Intelligence.

                    On the left is a reconstruction of the Colossus computer.
                    It is very complex and has many moving parts as well as many vaccum tubes used to store information.
                    Below is a simulator for what the machine would do to decrypt the German messages and how the Germans encoded their messages.
                    At Blechy Park the location for most British code breaking and the birth place of the original Colossus computer there were 19 Colossi at the end of the war.
                    The code breaking potential of all the computers was key to the Allied win on WWII and the downfall of the Axis.
                    It was also important that the Allies especially America and Britian shared their intelligence with each other.

                    Tommy Flowers deserves to be in the hall of fame for WWII Citizen Heroes because of his heroics behind the line that doubtlessly saved thousands of lives and impacted the war dramatically.
                    Tommy Flowers was one of the lead engineers/computer scientists at Bletchley Park along with other famous people like Alan Turing.
                    Tommy Flowers didnâ€™t fight on the front lines of the war instead, he worked in intelligence and more specifically in code-breaking and decryption.
                    Bletchley Park North of London was the main base of operations for decrypting German cyphers and messages.
                    The work carried out at Bletchley park was paramount to the Allied victory.
                    Th eintelligence gathered from decrypting German messages ranged from supply movements and troop movements to experimental weaponry and invasion plans.
                    Without the use of the Coloussus created by Tommy Flowers which decrypted Enigma Machine codes.
                    The use of the machines was complucated and sometimes would still need further decoding by people, but the accomplishments of the early computers was astounding and made previously impossible cyphers came in reach.
                    The decrypted messages played a key role in predicting German advancements and knowing the weak points in Germanies defences.
                    The decrypted messages also alerted the Allied troops of incoming attacks saving countless lives.
                    Without Tommy Flowers and his early computers many people would have died and the outcome of the war could have been different.
